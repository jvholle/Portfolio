Recent Development Portfolio:
1.  ReusableAnalysis: Return values from HIFLD fire department API and perform a simple analysis by determining the number of fire departments per city for an individual State.  Display the top five Mississippi cities with the highest number of fire departments in a graph derived from Pandas and Mathplotlib libraries.  
2.  ManageUserContent: Manage ArcGIS Online user content.  Temporary accounts in ArcGIS Online accumulate orphaned maps, layers, and other content.  Script iterates through a list of users and their content, and attempts to remove relationships between groups, layers, and apps in order to delete items.  If relationships are not removed and items cannot be directly deleted, the content is reassigned to an admin and deleted.  
3.   DataFinishing: Data finishing script to clean and augment datasets.  Used Regular Expressions and dictionaries to find and replace abbreviations and punctuation.  Used APIs to add County FIPs codes from FCC API, geocode addresses from ESRI world geocoder API, and fill in missing address fields with reverse geocoder.   
4.  Conference_Session_Info: Javascript App to provide real-time updates of conference sessions and their locations.  The app uses ESRI Javascript 3.5 API and several feature services to provide a conference map and upcoming and current sessions at a conference.
